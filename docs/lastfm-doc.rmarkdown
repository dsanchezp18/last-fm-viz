# Intro

This is the main project document, which includes all of the code needed to clean, analyze and visualize my Last.fm  data in R.

## Preliminaries

I load the libraries I will need in here. Mostly it is just the main *lastfmR* package which is currently uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/ppatrzyk/lastfmR) now, the typical *tidyverse* stuff and *lubridate* for date management.


```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(lastfmR) # If not downloaded, use remotes::install_github("ppatrzyk/lastfmR")
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```


# Getting the data

I will use the main function from the *lastfmR* package, which is `get_scrobbles()`, to get all of the scrobbles (songs listened/streamed) from my Last.fm account.


```{r}
#| label: get-data
#| eval: false
scrobbles <- get_scrobbles('damage_inc7', timezone = 'America/Bogota')

scrobbles
```


The `timezone` argument cannot be left as is since it will give me times which are not correct given the timezones. I listened to the majority of my music in Quito, Ecuador, so using that timezone fixes most of the problem, yet I will need to deal with some timezone changes later.

## Fixing timezones

I need to select the data beginning mid-August 2022 (when I travelled to Canada) and have it transformed to another timezone. While I could filter out all pre-trip data from Last.fm and bind it to another request to Last.fm but with another timezone, I choose to use *lubridate* for a smoother experience.


```{r}
#| label: timezone

scrobbles_can <- filter()

```
