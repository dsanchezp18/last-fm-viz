# Using R and Tableau to analyze music trends

This is the GitHub repository which holds all of the work required to reproduce this project. This can be done thanks to Piotr Patrzyk's [*lastfmR*](https://github.com/ppatrzyk/lastfmR) package.

The obtainment, cleaning and preliminary analysis of the data was done through R, and can be executed by downloading this repository to your computer and rendering the `.qmd` script or running all code chunks in that document. 

You may see the main visualization part of the project in my [Tableau Public account](hhttps://public.tableau.com/views/VisualizingScrobblesfromLast_fm/VisualizingListeningTrendsfromLast_fm?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

An interactive Shiny dashboard built with the **flexdashboard** package is currently in development.
